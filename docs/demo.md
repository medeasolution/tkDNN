# Run the demo

This is an example using YOLOv4. Once you have successfully created your TensorRT engine, run the demo:

```
./demo yolo4_fp32.rt ../demo/yolo_test.mp4 y
```

In general the demo program takes 7 parameters:

```
./demo <network-rt-file> <path-to-video> <kind-of-network> <number-of-classes> <n-batches> <show-flag>
```

where

* ```<network-rt-file>``` is the rt file generated by a test
* ```<<path-to-video>``` is the path to a video file or a camera input
* ```<kind-of-network>``` is the type of network. Thee types are currently supported: ```y``` (YOLO family), ```c``` (
  CenterNet family) and ```m``` (MobileNet-SSD family)
* ```<number-of-classes>```is the number of classes the network is trained on
* ```<n-batches>``` number of batches to use in inference (N.B. you should first export TKDNN_BATCHSIZE to the required
  n_batches and create again the rt file for the network).
* ```<show-flag>``` if set to 0 the demo will not show the visualization but save the video into result.mp4 (if
  n-batches ==1)
* ```<conf-thresh>``` confidence threshold for the detector. Only bounding boxes with threshold greater than conf-thresh
  will be displayed.
